# Instructions

### 1. Installing dependencies

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You can also deploy using CDK as well.

```
$ cdk deploy
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

### 2. IP Range Access

By default, if you run `cdk deploy`, the security group that is assigned to the load balancer won't be open to the public internet. This is for security purposes. Instead we need to allowlist an IP range using the cdk.json file. As an example:

```
"security_group_ip_range": null
```

could be set to

```
"security_group_ip_range": "31.89.197.141/32",
```

Which will give access to only `31.89.197.141`.

### 3. Accessing OpenEMR

After we run `cdk deploy`, we will receive a url in the terminal. Going to that URL on our browser will take us to the OpenEMR authentication page.

Username is `admin` and password can be retrieved from [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). Navigate to the AWS console and go the Secrets Manager service. You will see a secret there which has a name that starts with `Password...`.

After entering username and password we should be able to get access to the OpenEMR UI.

# Architecture and Cost

This solution uses a variety of AWS services including [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/), [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/), [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). For a full list you can review the cdk stack. Architecture diagram below shows how this solution comes together.

![alt text](./docs/Architecture.png)


Even though it will depend on a lot of factors such as traffic and storage, this solution costs around ~220$ per month based on our experiments. Majority of the costs will be incurred by Fargate and RDS. Feel free to change the RDS database to a smaller instance to reduce the cost even more.

# Regarding Security

### Using cdk_nag

We instrumented this project with [cdk_nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag). In your app.py file we placed 2 commented out cdk_nag checks.

```python
from cdk_nag import AwsSolutionsChecks, HIPAASecurityChecks

app = cdk.App()
cdk.Aspects.of(app).add(AwsSolutionsChecks(verbose=True))
cdk.Aspects.of(app).add(HIPAASecurityChecks(verbose=True))
```

If you'd like you can enable the cdk_nag checks and fix any issues found therein. While this may assist with complying with certain aspects of HIPAA we make no claims that this alone will result in compliance with HIPAA. Please see the general disclaimer at the top of this README for more information. 

### Container Vulnerabilities

We recommend periodically scanning the container image used in this project. There are multiple ways to achieve that goal. 2 of them are:

1. Upload the container image to ECR and enable scanning
2. You can use [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
