# Instructions

### 1. Installing dependencies

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You can also deploy using CDK as well.

```
$ cdk deploy
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

### 2. IP Range Access

By default, if you run `cdk deploy`, the security group that is assigned to the load balancer won't be open to the public internet. This is for security purposes. Instead we need to allowlist an IP range using the cdk.json file. As an example:

```
"security_group_ip_range": null
```

could be set to

```
"security_group_ip_range": "31.89.197.141/32",
```

Which will give access to only `31.89.197.141`.

### 3. Accessing OpenEMR

After we run `cdk deploy`, we will receive a url in the terminal. Going to that URL on our browser will take us to the OpenEMR authentication page.

![alt text](./docs/OpenEMR_Auth.png)


Username is `admin` and password can be retrieved from [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). Navigate to the AWS console and go the Secrets Manager service. You will see a secret there which has a name that starts with `Password...`.

![alt text](./docs/SecretsManager.png)


After entering username and password we should be able to get access to the OpenEMR UI.

# Architecture

This solution uses a variety of AWS services including [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/), [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/), [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). For a full list you can review the cdk stack. Architecture diagram below shows how this solution comes together.

![alt text](./docs/Architecture.png)

# Customizing Architecture Attributes

There are some additional parameters you can set in `cdk.json` that you can use to customize some attributes of your architecture.

 * `elasticache_cache_node_type`          The cache node type used by Elasticache. Defaults to "cache.t3.small".
 * `openemr_service_fargate_minimum_capacity`       Minimum number of fargate tasks running in your ECS cluster for your ECS service running OpenEMR. Defaults to 3.
 * `openemr_service_fargate_maximum_capacity`      Maximum number of fargate tasks running in your ECS cluster for your ECS service running OpenEMR. Defaults to 100.
 * `openemr_service_fargate_cpu_autoscaling_percentage`        Percent of average CPU utilization across your ECS cluster that will trigger an autoscaling event for your ECS service running OpenEMR. Defaults to 40.
 * `openemr_service_fargate_memory_autoscaling_percentage`        Percent of average memory utilization across your ECS cluster that will trigger an autoscaling event for your ECS service running OpenEMR. Defaults to 40.
 * `proxy_service_fargate_minimum_capacity`       Minimum number of fargate tasks running in your ECS cluster for your ECS service running your virtual gateway. Defaults to 3.
 * `proxy_service_fargate_maximum_capacity`      Maximum number of fargate tasks running in your ECS cluster for your ECS service running your virtual gateway. Defaults to 100.
 * `proxy_service_fargate_cpu_autoscaling_percentage`        Percent of average CPU utilization across your ECS cluster that will trigger an autoscaling event for your ECS service running your virtual gateway. Defaults to 40.
 * `proxy_service_fargate_memory_autoscaling_percentage`        Percent of average memory utilization across your ECS cluster that will trigger an autoscaling event for your ECS service running your virtual gateway. Defaults to 40.
 * `enable_ecs_exec`          Can be used to toggle ECS Exec functionality. Set to a value other than "true" to disable this functionality. Please note that this should generally be disabled while running in production for most workloads. Defaults to "true".
 * `certificate_arn`          If specified will enable HTTPS for client to load balancer communications and will associate the specified certificate with the application load balancer for this architecture. This value, if specified, should be a string of an ARN in AWS Certificate Manager.
 * `activate_openemr_apis`          Setting this value to `"true"` will enable both the [REST](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/API_README.md) and [FHIR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/FHIR_README.md) APIs. You'll need to authorize and generate a token to use most of the functionality of both APIs. Documentation on how authorization works can be found [here](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/API_README.md#authorization). When the OpenEMR APIs are activated the `"/apis/"` and `"/oauth2"` paths will be accessible. To disable the REST and FHIR APIs for OpenEMR set this value to something other than "true". For more information about this functionality see the `REST and FHIR APIs` section of this documention.

# Enabling HTTPS for Client to Load Balancer Communication

If the value for `certificate_arn` is specified to be a string referring to the ARN of a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager this will enable HTTPS on the load balancer.

Incoming requests on port 80 will be automatically redirected to port 443 and port 443 will be accepting HTTPS traffic and the load balancer will be associated with the certificate specified.

The certificate used must be a public certificate. For documentation on how to issue and manage certificates with AWS Certificate Manager see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs.html). For documentation on how to import certificates to AWS Certificate Manager see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html).

One of the advantages of issuing a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager is that AWS Certificate Manager provides managed renewal for AWS issued TLS/SSL certificates. For documentation on managed renewal in AWS Certificate Manager see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/managed-renewal.html).

# How AWS Backup is Used in this Architecture

This architecture comes set up to use [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) and has automatic backups set up for both AWS EFSs and the RDS database.

The backup plan used is `daily_weekly_monthly7_year_retention` which will take daily, weekly and monthly backups with 7 year retention.

For documentation on AWS Backup see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html).

# How AppMesh is Used in this Architecture

This architecture comes set up to use [AWS AppMesh](https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/) out of the box. This is used to provide certificates to enable TLS communication between the load balancer and ECS tasks that will run the application code.

This architecture creates an AWS Private Certificate Authority which is used to issue the certificates that are used for TLS communication between the load balancer and a gateway proxy service and also for TLS communication between the gateway proxy service and the backend service running OpenEMR.

If used in conjunction with HTTPS set up for traffic from clients to the load balancer this provides TLS/SSL for traffic all the way from an end user to the application code.

# Using XRay

This architecture comes set up to use AWS XRay which can be used to help benchmark and debug applications. For more information on AWS Xray see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/).

An example of what the AWS XRay service map for this architecture looks like can be found here:

![alt text](./docs/XRay.png)

# Using ECS Exec

This architecture allows you to use ECS Exec to get a root command line prompt on a running container. Please note that this should generally be disabled while running in production for most workloads. For information on how to toggle this functionality see the `enable_ecs_exec` parameter in the `Customizing Architecture Attributes` section of this documentation.

For more instructions on how to use ECS Exec see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html#ecs-exec-enabling-and-using).

For an example of a command that could be run either in [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html) or elsewhere to get root access to a container see the code below:

```
aws ecs execute-command --cluster $name_of_ecs_cluster \
    --task $arn_of_fargate_task \
    --container openemr \
    --interactive \
    --command "/bin/sh"
```

# Notes on HIPAA Compliance in General

If you are an AWS customer who is a HIPAA covered entity you would need to sign a business associate addendum (BAA) before running anything that would be considered in-scope for HIPAA on AWS.

Please note that you would have to sign a separate business associate addendum for _each AWS account_ where you would want to run anything that would be considered in-scope for HIPAA on AWS.

Documentation on HIPAA compliance on AWS in general and how one would sign a BAA can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/).

You can use AWS Artifact in the AWS console to find and agree to the BAA. Documentation on getting started with using AWS Artifact can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/getting-started/).

While this may assist with complying with certain aspects of HIPAA we make no claims that this alone will result in compliance with HIPAA. Please see the general disclaimer at the top of this README for more information.

# REST and FHIR APIs

OpenEMR has functionality for both [FHIR](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/FHIR_README.md) and [REST](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/API_README.md) APIs. You can toggle both of these APIs on or off for this architecture by changing the value for `activate_openemr_apis` in the cdk.json. Setting this value to `"true"` will enable both the REST and FHIR APIs. 

You'll need to authorize and generate a token to use most of the functionality of both APIs. Documentation on how authorization works can be found [here](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/blob/master/API_README.md#authorization). 

When the OpenEMR APIs are activated the `"/apis/"` and `"/oauth2"` paths will be accessible.

An example call you can make to test the FHIR API that you don't need to authenticate for is a call to the metadata endpoint. An example of that call can be found below:

`curl -X GET '<url_for_your_alb_or_a_dns_record_pointing_to_your_alb>/apis/default/fhir/metadata`

If that call goes well you should get back a decently sized JSON in response.

# Regarding Security

### Using cdk_nag

We instrumented this project with [cdk_nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag). In your app.py file we placed 2 commented out cdk_nag checks.

```python
from cdk_nag import AwsSolutionsChecks, HIPAASecurityChecks

app = cdk.App()
cdk.Aspects.of(app).add(AwsSolutionsChecks(verbose=True))
cdk.Aspects.of(app).add(HIPAASecurityChecks(verbose=True))
```

If you'd like you can enable the cdk_nag checks and fix any issues found therein. While this may assist with complying with certain aspects of HIPAA we make no claims that this alone will result in compliance with HIPAA. Please see the general disclaimer at the top of this README for more information. 

### Container Vulnerabilities

We recommend periodically scanning the container image used in this project. There are multiple ways to achieve that goal. 2 of them are:

1. Upload the container image to ECR and enable scanning
2. You can use [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
